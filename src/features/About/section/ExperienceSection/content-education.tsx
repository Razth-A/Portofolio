          I enrolled in the Software Engineering program with the motivation
          that commercial jobs would be replaced by technology in the future, so
          I decided to pursue this major.

          Over the past five semesters, I've become more interested in App
          Development and Cybersecurity, and I even created an app for a job
          opening that was recently released on the Play Store{" "}

          to meet client demand during my internship.

          Starting this semester, I realized that coding was my primary goal in
          pursuing this major. Therefore, I started learning programming and
          fell in love with it.âœ¨
